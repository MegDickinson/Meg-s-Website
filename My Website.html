	<p>Hey, I'm Meg. I'm a marketing professional working in New York, NY. While I love my current position in marketing, I recently worked on a website project that immediately intrigued me. I am learining to code and will eventually work on more projects as a Web Developer. My other passions include traveling, cooking, reading, yoga, spending time outdoors, hiking, coffee, wine delicious food and spending time with family and friends. I'm a creative individual with a long bucket list of goals i'd like to accomplish. I have a love for animals and the environment and hope to make an impact on the world someday.</p>
